# PageofCalculators
Welcome to my Page of Calculators!

On this page, you will find a simple calculator. It works and take double digits and now takes decimals. As of now, the screen shows "undefined" but I am working to fix that. 

Other possible calculators that might be on this page are:

	-BMI calculator--original and maybe the 2013 Oxford University version that accounts for tall people (I will add a link to the study if I add this)
	-Per hour wage to annual salary converter
	-Annual salary converter to hourly wage
	-More enhancements to the simple calculator such as pi (for now, divide 22 by 7 and you will get pi) or percentages. 
	-And...any other calculator you would like to see!
